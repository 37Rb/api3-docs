Staking tokens in the DAO pool gives you governance rights to create and vote on proposals. To create a proposal, you must hold at least 0.1% of the total pool shares and not have created a proposal in the last seven days. This required percentage, set in the [`Api3Pool.sol`](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-dao/blob/main/packages/pool/contracts/Api3Pool.sol) contract, can be adjusted by the DAO. You can vote on all proposals or delegate your voting power to someone else.

## Using ENS Names

If you use an ENS name when creating a proposal, the Dashboard contracts will remember the public address assigned to the ENS name at the time of the proposal. If the proposal passes, the payout will go to the public address the ENS name pointed to when the proposal was created.

Therefore changing the address of the ENS after making a proposal can be problematic. Consider the following. 
- You buy an ENS name and assign it to a public address you own. 
- You make a proposal using the ENS.
- While the proposal is active, you point your ENS name to another address.
- The proposal passes. You expect to receive the funds to the new address, but you will receive the funds at the old address.
  
## Getting Started

1. Access the [DAO Dashboard](https://api3.eth.link/)
2. Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the upper right hand corner and connect to your wallet using the mainnet.

## Proposals and History

  The **Governance** page displays a list of active proposals and the **History** page displays proposals that have been executed or rejected.

  :::: tabs
  ::: tab Read & Learn
  1. Navigate to the **Governance** page.

  Here you can browse and write proposals, view the treasury and delegate your votes.  The **Active proposals** list displays all proposals open for voting. There are two types of proposals, primary and secondary. Primary proposals require an absolute majority vote while secondary proposals require a 15% vote to pass. For each proposal in the list you can see the title, proposal type, vote deadline and vote status.

  To view additional details click on the desired proposal. In addition to the information from the list item selected, the detail view shows your vote delegation status and a **Summary** section with the details of the proposal.

  2. To view previous governance proposals select **History** in the navigation bar.
  
  > Proposals in the history list have either been executed or rejected.

## Proposal Creation
  Proposals are an important part of DAO governance and can be used to fund DAO projects or ratify DAO level decisions like updating the stake target.

  To create a new proposal:
  - you must hold at least 0.1% of the total pool shares
  - you have not created a proposal in the last seven days

  In general, the Primary voting app has a larger treasury and more permissions but has more stringent voting settings. For a technical breakdown of the different permissions granted to the DAO's two voting apps (and corresponding Agents) see this [README](https://github.com/api3dao/api3-dao/blob/develop/packages/dao/README.md#permissions).

  :::: tabs
  ::: tab Read & Learn

  1. Click the **New Proposal** button on the Governance page.

  2. Select the **Proposal Type** on the proposal form.

  > Proposals can be submitted to either the *Primary* or *Secondary* voting types. These two types have access to separate treasuries, have different voting settings, and have different permissions to change contract settings.

  3. Enter a descriptive **Title**.
  > The title will appear on the Governance page and is used to identify the proposal. A good descriptive title will help others navigate the proposal list.

  4. Enter a **Description** that details the proposal.
  5. Enter the **Target Contract** address.
  > This is the address of the contract to call.
  6. Enter the **Contract Target Signature**.
  > Defines the signature of the function to call within the contract.
  7. Enter an **ETH Value**.
  > You can use zero if the target function is not payable.
  8. Enter **Parameters** which are the arguments that will be used to satisfy the signature of the target function.
  > The arguments must be provided in JSON array format where the values are stringified.
  9. When you are ready, click the **Create** button at the bottom of the page.
  > After the proposal is created it is added to the proposal list and ready for voting.

## Proposal Execution

A proposal is ready for execution if:

1. the proposal hasn't already been executed, and 
2. greater than 50% of all voting power has voted "yes" on the proposal,

OR

1. the proposal hasn't already been executed, and 
2. the proposal's voting period has ended, and
3. the total "yes" vote exceeds the "no" vote, and
4. at least 50% (for Primary voting app proposals) or 15% (for Secondary voting app proposals) of all voting power has voted "yes" on the proposal.
